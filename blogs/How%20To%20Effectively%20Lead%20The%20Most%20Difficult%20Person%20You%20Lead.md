I had a problem. I kept laying books around the house when my wife asked me consistently to put them back on the shelf when I was finished. That isn't an issue in any average home, but it can get overwhelming in our house, where I have spent the equivalent of a second college degree on books. So, my wife had every right to ask me to corral the chaos. And here I am, weeks into a mess of my own creation. Books were strewn all over my desk, on the floor, by my bed, on the dresser, and in the kitchen. I told you I have a problem.
 

But my loving wife decided to rescue me. She found a new system for storing books and decided to try it. When I came home, my books were all rearranged. All my books all over the house were neatly back on the shelves where they belonged. And from that day forward, as long as the system is in effect (we have moved and the books haven't been unpacked and organized) and books are again organized in my wife's ingenious way, they always get put back where they belong–on the shelf.
